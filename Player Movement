/*This is for player movement, so transform is any sort of movement whether it be 
rotating or moving around, and you see i just add different endings, 
like translate is to physically move, and rotate is to obviously rotate. 
I use one variable called speed, so i can adjust the players speed really easily. 
The brackets after the two translates are called method overloading, 
it means putting your own inputs and values to an action in code, so i
put the input as "vertical" for movement, and horizontal for rotating, 
meaning if i press the left and right arrow ill turn, and the up and down ill actually move! */
