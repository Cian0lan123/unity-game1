/* This is the code that will detect a click and remove the block you clicked. By far the most advanced of the 3-4 pieces
of code I've put up. Raycast is almost all about detecting where you clicked on the screen, and using that info to know
what to destroy. I won't go into detail about how it works, its a bit too ahead of where you are now. */
