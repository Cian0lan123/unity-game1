/* So this ones a little bit trickier, basically i have two different cubes in the game,
which you have to assign to the game objects. Make two cubes, and look at where you attached the script
to the player, you'll see two boxes labelled 'guideline' and 'block'. drag the two cubes from the hierarchy
to these spots, and then make the two blocks "children" of the player. This means that where the player will
move, the blocks move too. To make a block a child of another block, drag the child block in the hierarchy
onto the other block. you'll notice a dropdown menu is made and the child is below the "parent". Don't 
worry too much about this stuff, its a little bit tricky. Try setting it up, and if it works start messing
around with the script. Even if you mess it up its saved here. Take lines out and try and run the code, 
you'll quickly learn what does what. */
